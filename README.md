# AI Notes App

This is a note-taking app with an **AI chatbot** that can answer questions based on the user's notes using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). We use **Convex** for the backend & authentication, the **Vercel AI SDK v5** for streaming and tool-calling, and the **OpenAI API** for the LLM.
